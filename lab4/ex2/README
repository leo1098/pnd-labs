A lan with a host, a server, a router. There is also an external lan
for connecting the host machine.
You have to experiment with ip6tables

NOTE: if you obtain the error "Table does not exist (do you need 
to insmod?)" issue the following command in the host machine

$ sudo modprobe ip6table_filter

FOR SOLUTION
connect to the 'external' network using the script with a ipv4/6 address

add route:
sudo ip r add 192.168.10.0/24 via 192.168.10.10 dev veth0
or
sudo ip -6 r add 2001:db8:cafe::/48 via 2001:db8:cafe:2::1 dev veth0
