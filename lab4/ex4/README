A local lan with 2 pc, a default gateway. The assignment is to properly
configure the router to act NAT and regulation.

- r1 has to act as the router and masquerade the packet that exit
  from its eth1 interface (notice that eth1 IP is dynamically assigned)

- r1 has also to accept ICMP echo replies destined to LAN

- r1 has to drop any packet to itself from eth1, but ICMP requests

- r1 has to respond with TCP RST or ICMP Unreachable for incoming
  requests for blocked ports

FOR SOLUTION:

# natting
iptables -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE

# drop all packets and deal with icmp
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -p icmp --icmp-type=echo-reply -o eth0 -j ACCEPT

iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -j REJECT
iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -p icmp -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -j REJECT --reject-with=icmp-net-unreachable
